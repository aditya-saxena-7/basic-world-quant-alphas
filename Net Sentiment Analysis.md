### Alpha Strategy: Net Sentiment Analysis

#### Concept
This alpha strategy is based on the hypothesis that if the net sentiment of a company (positive sentiment minus negative sentiment) is improving compared to earlier periods, the stock price is likely to increase. By analyzing sentiment data over time and using various time series operators, the strategy aims to identify stocks with improving market perception, which can drive stock price increases.

**Key Components:**

1. **Positive Sentiment:**
   - Represents positive mentions or sentiment scores in news articles, social media posts, and other public sources.
   - **Layman Example:** If a company is frequently praised in the media or on social media, it has a high positive sentiment.

2. **Negative Sentiment:**
   - Represents negative mentions or sentiment scores in news articles, social media posts, and other public sources.
   - **Layman Example:** If a company is frequently criticized or has bad news circulating, it has a high negative sentiment.

3. **Net Sentiment:**
   - Calculated as the difference between positive sentiment and negative sentiment.
   - **Layman Example:** If a company has 70 positive mentions and 30 negative mentions, the net sentiment is 40.

4. **Time Series Operator:**
   - A function that applies calculations over a specified period to track changes and trends.
   - **Layman Example:** Analyzing how net sentiment changes over a week, month, quarter, or year.

5. **Backfill Operation:**
   - Handles missing data by filling gaps with the most recent non-missing value.
   - **Layman Example:** If sentiment data for certain days are missing, backfill fills these gaps with the most recent available data to ensure continuous analysis.

6. **Ranking:**
   - Ranks sentiment values to normalize the data and reduce noise.
   - **Layman Example:** Assigning a rank to sentiment values to compare them on a standardized scale.

7. **Comparison Operator:**
   - Compares positive sentiment with negative sentiment.
   - **Layman Example:** Subtracting negative sentiment from positive sentiment to get net sentiment.

#### Implementation

1. **Calculate Positive and Negative Sentiment:**
   - Compute the positive and negative sentiment scores for each stock.

2. **Backfill Sentiment Data:**
   - Use backfill operations to handle missing sentiment data.
   - Example: \( \text{backfilled_positive_sentiment} = \text{ts_backfill}(\text{positive_sentiment}, \text{days}) \)
   - Example: \( \text{backfilled_negative_sentiment} = \text{ts_backfill}(\text{negative_sentiment}, \text{days}) \)

3. **Rank Sentiment Data:**
   - Rank the backfilled sentiment data.
   - Example: \( \text{ranked_positive_sentiment} = \text{rank}(\text{backfilled_positive_sentiment}) \)
   - Example: \( \text{ranked_negative_sentiment} = \text{rank}(\text{backfilled_negative_sentiment}) \)

4. **Calculate Sentiment Difference:**
   - Compute the difference between ranked positive and negative sentiment.
   - Example: \( \text{sentiment_difference} = \text{ranked_positive_sentiment} - \text{ranked_negative_sentiment} \)

5. **Apply Time Series Operator:**
   - Use a time series operator to analyze changes in sentiment difference over a specified period.
   - Example: \( \text{net_sentiment_trend} = \text{time_series_operator}(\text{sentiment_difference}, \text{days}) \)

6. **Identify Stocks with Improving Sentiment:**
   - Identify stocks where the net sentiment trend is positive, indicating improving market perception.

#### Why It Works

**Example:**

Imagine we have two companies, Company A and Company B. We will analyze their sentiment data over the last quarter (60 days).

1. **Calculate Positive and Negative Sentiment:**
   - **Company A:**
     - Positive Sentiment: 70
     - Negative Sentiment: 30
   - **Company B:**
     - Positive Sentiment: 40
     - Negative Sentiment: 20

2. **Backfill Sentiment Data:**
   - Fill any missing sentiment data over the last 60 days.

3. **Rank Sentiment Data:**
   - Rank the sentiment values.
   - **Company A:**
     - Ranked Positive Sentiment: 0.7
     - Ranked Negative Sentiment: 0.3
   - **Company B:**
     - Ranked Positive Sentiment: 0.4
     - Ranked Negative Sentiment: 0.2

4. **Calculate Sentiment Difference:**
   - **Company A:**
     - Sentiment Difference: \(0.7 - 0.3 = 0.4\)
   - **Company B:**
     - Sentiment Difference: \(0.4 - 0.2 = 0.2\)

5. **Apply Time Series Operator:**
   - Analyze the changes in sentiment difference over the last 60 days.
   - **Company A:** Sentiment difference increased from 0.3 to 0.4.
   - **Company B:** Sentiment difference remained constant at 0.2.

6. **Identify Stocks with Improving Sentiment:**
   - **Company A:** Shows an increasing sentiment difference, indicating improving market perception.
   - **Company B:** Shows a constant sentiment difference, indicating no significant change in market perception.

**Why It Works:**

1. **Market Perception:** Positive sentiment indicates that the market views the company favorably, which can drive investor interest and stock price increases.
2. **Reduction of Noise:** Ranking and backfilling sentiment data help normalize the values and reduce noise, making the analysis more reliable.
3. **Early Detection:** By tracking sentiment trends, the strategy can detect improvements in market perception early, before they fully reflect in the stock price.
4. **Behavioral Finance:** Investors often react to news and sentiment. Positive sentiment can lead to buying pressure, driving up stock prices.

### Summary
This alpha strategy leverages sentiment analysis to identify stocks with improving market perception. By calculating and ranking sentiment data, handling missing values, and applying time series analysis, the strategy can pinpoint stocks that are gaining positive sentiment over time. The example illustrates how the strategy evaluates sentiment trends and why it works, highlighting the benefits of using sentiment analysis to drive investment decisions.
