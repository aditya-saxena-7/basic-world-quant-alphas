### Alpha Strategy: Short Overpriced Companies

#### Alpha Formula
**Formula:**
\[ \text{Alpha} = -\text{ts\_zscore}\left(\frac{\text{Enterprise Value}}{\text{EBITDA}}, 63\right) \]

Where:
- **Enterprise Value (EV):** The total value of a company, including its market capitalization, debt, and excluding cash.
- **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, a measure of a company's overall financial performance.
- **ts_zscore:** Time series z-score, a statistical measure that describes a value's relation to the mean of a group of values over a specified lookback period (63 days in this case).

#### Parameters:
- **Top 3000 stocks:** The strategy applies to the top 3000 stocks by market capitalization or liquidity.
- **Industry neutralization:** The portfolio is balanced to have an equal weight of long and short positions within each industry, reducing industry-wide risk.

### Alpha Strategy: Short Overpriced Companies

#### Strategy Logic

#### Concept
This alpha strategy identifies and shorts stocks with rising valuations that are higher than their earnings, relative to their peers within the same industry. The strategy uses the enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, focusing on fundamental valuations rather than just price movements.

**Key Components:**

1. **Enterprise Value (EV):** 
   - EV is the total value of a company, including its market capitalization (the total value of all its shares), debt, and excluding cash.
   - **Layman Example:** Imagine you want to buy a company. You need to consider not just the stock price but also its debts and the cash it holds. EV gives you a comprehensive picture of the company‚Äôs value.

2. **EBITDA:** 
   - Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. It measures a company's overall financial performance.
   - **Layman Example:** Think of EBITDA as the company‚Äôs profit from its core operations, without considering the costs of borrowing money, taxes, and accounting adjustments.

3. **EV/EBITDA Ratio:** 
   - This ratio compares the total value of the company to its earnings, providing a measure of how expensive or cheap the company is relative to its earnings.
   - **Layman Example:** It‚Äôs like comparing the price of a house to the rent it can generate. A high EV/EBITDA means the company (or house) is expensive compared to its earnings (or rent).

#### Execution

1. **Calculate EV/EBITDA Ratio:**
   - For each stock, calculate the enterprise value and EBITDA, then find their ratio.
2. **Compute Time Series Z-Score:**
   - Calculate the z-score of the EV/EBITDA ratio over the past 63 days to understand how current valuations compare to historical averages.
3. **Short Overpriced Stocks:**
   - Rank stocks by their z-scores within their industry. The strategy suggests shorting stocks with the highest (most positive) z-scores, as these are considered overpriced relative to their historical valuations.

#### Why It Works

**Example:**

Imagine we have two stocks, Stock A and Stock B, both in the top 3000 by market capitalization. We analyze their EV/EBITDA ratios over the last 63 days.

1. **Calculate EV/EBITDA Ratio:**
   - **Stock A:** EV = $200 million, EBITDA = $20 million.
     \[ \text{EV/EBITDA} = \frac{200}{20} = 10 \]
   - **Stock B:** EV = $300 million, EBITDA = $10 million.
     \[ \text{EV/EBITDA} = \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

2. **Compute Time Series Z-Score:**
   - **Stock A:** The historical average EV/EBITDA is 8 with a standard deviation of 1. Current ratio = 10.
     \[ \text{Z-Score} = \frac{10 - 8}{1} = 2 \]
   - **Stock B:** The historical average EV/EBITDA is 20 with a standard deviation of 5. Current ratio = 30.
     \[ \text{Z-Score} = \frac{30 - 20}{5} = 2 \]

   Both stocks have a z-score of 2, but Stock B‚Äôs absolute valuation is much higher relative to its earnings.

3. **Short Overpriced Stocks:**
   - Since both stocks have high z-scores, they are considered overpriced relative to their historical valuations. The strategy suggests shorting both, but Stock B, with a higher absolute EV/EBITDA ratio, might be a more compelling short candidate.

**Why It Works:**

1. **Fundamental Valuation:** The EV/EBITDA ratio provides a fundamental measure of valuation, comparing a company‚Äôs total value to its earnings. High ratios indicate potential overvaluation.
2. **Relative Comparison:** By using the z-score, the strategy compares current valuations to historical averages, identifying stocks that are significantly more expensive than usual.
3. **Industry Neutralization:** Balancing positions within industries minimizes exposure to sector-wide movements, focusing on relative overvaluation within the industry.
4. **Mean Reversion:** Overpriced stocks are likely to experience price corrections as the market adjusts to more reasonable valuations, providing profitable short opportunities.

### Summary
This alpha strategy leverages fundamental valuation metrics to identify and short overpriced stocks within industries. By focusing on the EV/EBITDA ratio and using time series z-scores, the strategy can effectively pinpoint stocks that are significantly overvalued relative to their earnings, providing profitable shorting opportunities. The example illustrates how the strategy evaluates and ranks stocks, highlighting why it works in identifying and exploiting overvaluations.

### Terminologies

#### Enterprise Value (EV) üíº
- **Definition:** The total value of a company, including its market capitalization, debt, and excluding cash.
- **Example:** If a company has a market capitalization of $100 million, debt of $20 million, and cash of $10 million, the enterprise value is:
  \[ \text{EV} = \$100 \text{ million} + \$20 \text{ million} - \$10 \text{ million} = \$110 \text{ million} \]

#### EBITDA üíµ
- **Definition:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. It measures a company's overall financial performance.
- **Example:** If a company has revenues of $50 million, expenses (excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of $30 million, the EBITDA is:
  \[ \text{EBITDA} = \$50 \text{ million} - \$30 \text{ million} = \$20 \text{ million} \]

#### Time Series Z-Score (ts_zscore) üìä
- **Definition:** A statistical measure that describes a value's relation to the mean of a group of values over a specified lookback period.
- **Example:** If a stock‚Äôs EV/EBITDA ratio has a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2 over the past 63 days, and the current ratio is 14, the z-score is:
  \[ \text{Z-Score} = \frac{14 - 10}{2} = 2 \]

#### Industry Neutralization ‚öñÔ∏è
- **Definition:** A strategy that balances long and short positions within each industry to reduce exposure to industry-wide movements.
- **Example:** If you short $1 million in tech stocks, you also hold $1 million in tech stocks you expect to go up, balancing the portfolio within that industry.

### Performance Metrics

#### Sharpe Ratio üìà
- **Definition:** A measure of the risk-adjusted return of an investment. It is the ratio of the return of the investment to its standard deviation.
- **Example:** A Sharpe ratio of 2.00 means the strategy returns 2.00 units of return for every unit of risk.

#### Turnover üîÑ
- **Definition:** The percentage of the portfolio that is bought and sold over a period.
- **Example:** A turnover rate of 25% means that one-fourth of the portfolio's holdings are changed during the period.

#### Annual Returns üìÖ
- **Definition:** The percentage gain or loss in the value of the portfolio over a year.
- **Example:** An annual return of 10% means the portfolio's value increases by 10% over a year.

#### Fitness üí™
- **Definition:** A measure of how well the alpha fits the historical data.
- **Example:** A fitness of 1.26 suggests the alpha performs 26% better than expected based on historical data.

### Why It Works
1. **Fundamental Focus:** This strategy uses fundamental data (EV/EBITDA ratio) which is more stable and changes less frequently than price-volume data, leading to lower turnover.
2. **Industry Neutralization:** By being industry-neutral, the strategy minimizes exposure to industry-wide movements, focusing on relative overvaluation within the industry.
3. **Timely Analysis:** The use of a 63-day lookback period captures the most recent earnings and valuation trends, making the strategy responsive to quarterly reports.

### Learning Points for Beginners
- **Fundamental Analysis:** Understand how fundamental metrics like EV/EBITDA can indicate overvaluation or undervaluation.
- **Z-Score Usage:** Learn how statistical measures like the z-score help compare current values to historical averages.
- **Industry Neutralization:** Recognize the importance of balancing positions within industries to reduce specific risks.
- **Key Metrics:** Familiarize yourself with key performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, turnover, and annual returns to evaluate strategy effectiveness.
- **Backtesting:** Appreciate the value of historical backtesting to validate strategies before real-world application.

This strategy highlights how a focus on fundamental valuations and industry-relative comparisons can identify overpriced stocks to short, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining quantitative and fundamental analysis.
