### Alpha Strategy: Hot News with Reversion

#### Alpha Formula
**Formula:**
\[ \text{Alpha} = \text{rank}\left(\text{ts\_sum}(\text{avg\_news}, 60)\right) > 0.5 ? 1 : \text{rank}\left(-\text{ts\_delta}(\text{close}, 2)\right) \]

Where:
- **avg_news:** Average news sentiment or score after certain news events (nws12_afterhsz_sl).
- **ts_sum:** The sum of a time series over a specified period (60 days here).
- **rank:** A function that assigns a relative rank to a value within a group.
- **ts_delta:** The change in the time series over a specified period (2 days here).

#### Data Fields:
- **avg_news:** The average sentiment or impact of news articles.
- **close:** The closing price of the stock.
- **rank:** A ranking function that assigns a rank based on the value.

#### Parameters:
- **Top 3000 stocks:** The strategy applies to the top 3000 stocks by market capitalization or liquidity.
- **Subindustry neutralization:** The portfolio is balanced to have an equal weight of long and short positions within each subindustry, reducing subindustry-wide risk.

### Alpha Strategy: Hot News with Reversion

#### Strategy Logic

#### Concept
This alpha strategy blends two distinct approaches: momentum based on news and a price reversion strategy. The goal is to leverage the influence of news on stock prices while also capitalizing on the natural tendency of stock prices to revert to their mean.

**Key Components:**

1. **News-Based Momentum:**
   - Stocks that are frequently mentioned in the news and have positive sentiment tend to gain investor attention, which can drive prices up.
   - By ranking stocks based on their news coverage and sentiment, the strategy identifies which stocks are currently receiving significant attention.

2. **Price Reversion for Less Newsworthy Stocks:**
   - For stocks that are not receiving much news coverage, the strategy assumes that their prices might still revert to their mean. This is based on the mean reversion principle, where prices tend to move back to their average levels over time.

3. **Subindustry Neutralization:**
   - By neutralizing positions within subindustries, the strategy reduces the risk of broad sector movements and focuses on relative performance within each subindustry.

#### Execution
1. **Calculate Average News Impact:**
   - Determine the average news sentiment or score for each stock over a period.
2. **Sum News Impact over 60 Days:**
   - Sum the average news scores over the past 60 days for each stock.
3. **Rank News Impact:**
   - Rank the stocks based on the summed news impact. If the rank is above the median (0.5), it suggests significant news coverage.
4. **Decision Rule:**
   - If a stock‚Äôs news rank is above the median (0.5), assign a buy signal based on news momentum.
   - If a stock‚Äôs news rank is below the median, apply a price reversion strategy by ranking the negative 2-day price change and buying the higher-ranked stocks.

#### Why It Works

**Example:**

Imagine we have two stocks, Stock A and Stock B, both in the top 3000 by market capitalization. We analyze their news coverage and price movements over the last 60 days.

1. **Calculate Average News Impact:**
   - **Stock A:** Receives frequent positive mentions in news articles.
   - **Stock B:** Receives little to no news coverage.

2. **Sum News Impact over 60 Days:**
   - **Stock A:** Sum of average news sentiment scores over 60 days is high.
   - **Stock B:** Sum of average news sentiment scores over 60 days is low.

3. **Rank News Impact:**
   - **Stock A:** Ranks high based on summed news impact, indicating it is relatively newsworthy.
   - **Stock B:** Ranks low based on summed news impact.

4. **Decision Rule:**
   - **Stock A:** Since its news rank is above the median (0.5), it gets a buy signal based on news momentum.
   - **Stock B:** Since its news rank is below the median, apply a price reversion strategy:
     - Rank the negative 2-day price change. If Stock B has a significant price drop over the last 2 days, it may be considered for a buy signal based on the expectation of mean reversion.

**Why It Works:**

1. **News Impact on Prices:**
   - Positive news coverage can drive investor interest and buying activity, leading to higher stock prices. This momentum can be captured by buying stocks with significant news coverage.

2. **Mean Reversion:**
   - Stocks that do not receive much news coverage might still follow mean reversion patterns. When these stocks experience a significant price drop, they are likely to revert to their mean price, providing a buying opportunity.

3. **Subindustry Neutralization:**
   - By balancing positions within subindustries, the strategy minimizes exposure to broad sector movements and focuses on the relative performance of stocks within each subindustry. This helps isolate the impact of news and price reversion from general market or sector trends.

#### Execution
1. **Calculate Average News Impact:**
   - Determine the average news sentiment or score for each stock.
2. **Sum News Impact over 60 Days:**
   - Sum the average news scores over the past 60 days for each stock.
3. **Rank News Impact:**
   - Rank the stocks based on the summed news impact.
4. **Decision Rule:**
   - If the stock's news rank is above the median (0.5), assign a buy signal (1).
   - If the stock's news rank is below the median, apply a price reversion strategy by ranking the negative 2-day price change and buying the higher-ranked stocks.

### Terminologies

#### Average News Sentiment (avg_news) üì∞
- **Definition:** The average impact or sentiment score of news articles related to a stock.
- **Example:** If a stock has three news articles with sentiment scores of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.8, the avg_news is:
  \[ \text{avg\_news} = \frac{0.6 + 0.4 + 0.8}{3} = 0.6 \]

#### Time Series Sum (ts_sum) üìä
- **Definition:** The total sum of a time series over a specified period.
- **Example:** If the avg_news scores over 5 days are [0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.3], the ts_sum over these days is:
  \[ \text{ts\_sum} = 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.4 + 0.7 + 0.3 = 2.5 \]

#### Time Series Delta (ts_delta) üìâ
- **Definition:** The change in the time series value over a specified period.
- **Example:** If a stock's closing prices over two days are $100 and $105, the 2-day ts_delta is:
  \[ \text{ts\_delta} = 105 - 100 = 5 \]

#### Rank üî¢
- **Definition:** A function that assigns a relative ranking to each stock based on a specific value.
- **Example:** If you rank stocks based on their news impact scores, the stock with the highest score gets rank 1, the second-highest gets rank 2, and so on.

#### Subindustry Neutralization ‚öñÔ∏è
- **Definition:** A strategy that balances long and short positions within each subindustry to reduce exposure to subindustry-wide movements.
- **Example:** If you invest $1 million in stocks within the pharmaceutical subindustry and also short $1 million in stocks within the same subindustry, you are subindustry-neutral.

### Performance Metrics

#### Sharpe Ratio üìà
- **Definition:** A measure of the risk-adjusted return of an investment. It is the ratio of the return of the investment to its standard deviation.
- **Example:** A Sharpe ratio of 1.84 means the strategy returns 1.84 units of return for every unit of risk.

#### Turnover üîÑ
- **Definition:** The percentage of the portfolio that is bought and sold over a period.
- **Example:** A turnover rate of 9% means that 9% of the portfolio's holdings are changed during the period.

#### Annual Returns üìÖ
- **Definition:** The percentage gain or loss in the value of the portfolio over a year.
- **Example:** An annual return of 4.29% means the portfolio's value increases by 4.29% over a year.

#### Fitness üí™
- **Definition:** A measure of how well the alpha fits the historical data.
- **Example:** A fitness of 1.08 suggests the alpha performs 8% better than expected based on historical data.

### Why It Works
1. **News Impact:** This strategy captures the momentum effect where stocks with positive news tend to perform better in the short term.
2. **Reversion for Less Newsworthy Stocks:** By applying a simple price reversion strategy to less newsworthy stocks, the alpha leverages mean reversion tendencies.
3. **Subindustry Neutralization:** Balancing positions within subindustries minimizes exposure to sector-wide movements, focusing on relative performance within subindustries.
4. **Dynamic Strategy:** The combination of news-based momentum and price reversion makes the strategy adaptable to different market conditions.

### Learning Points for Beginners
- **Combining Strategies:** Learn how combining different strategies (momentum based on news and price reversion) can improve overall performance.
- **News Sentiment Analysis:** Understand the importance of news sentiment and its impact on stock prices.
- **Subindustry Neutralization:** Recognize the benefits of neutralizing positions within subindustries to reduce specific risks.
- **Key Metrics:** Familiarize yourself with key performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, turnover, and annual returns to evaluate strategy effectiveness.
- **Backtesting:** Appreciate the value of historical backtesting to validate strategies before real-world application.

This strategy highlights the effectiveness of blending momentum and reversion approaches, leveraging both news sentiment and price movements to generate consistent returns with lower turnover.
