### Alpha Strategy: Complicated Price Reversion

#### Alpha Formula
**Formula:**
rel_days_since_max = rank(ts_arg_max(close, 30));
decline_pct = (vwap - close) / close;
decline_pct / min( ts_decay_linear(rel_days_since_max, 1), 0.15)

#### Data Fields:
- **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price):** An average price that takes into account the volume traded at different prices.
- **Close:** The final price at which the stock traded when the market closed.
- **Rank:** A ranking function that assigns a rank based on the value.
- **Time Since Max (ts_arg_max):** The number of days since the stock reached its maximum price in the past 30 days.
- **Linear Decay:** A function that decreases the value linearly over time.

#### Parameters:
- **Top 200 stocks:** The strategy applies to the top 200 stocks by market capitalization or liquidity.
- **Market neutralization:** The portfolio is balanced to have an equal weight of long and short positions across the market.

### Strategy Logic

#### Concept
This alpha strategy is a refined version of the simple price reversion idea. It incorporates the concept of **relative time since the stock's peak** to identify stocks that have recently experienced a maximum price and then declined. The use of VWAP instead of the simple average price provides a more accurate measure of the average price.

#### Execution
1. **Calculate Relative Days Since Max:**
   - Determine the number of days since the stock last hit its highest price in the past 30 days.
   - Rank this value among all stocks.
2. **Calculate Decline Percentage:**
   - Compute the percentage decline from the VWAP to the closing price.
3. **Combine Metrics:**
   - Divide the decline percentage by the minimum of the linear decay of relative days since max and 0.15.

### Terminologies

#### VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) üìä
- **Definition:** VWAP is the average price a stock has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.
- **Example:** If a stock traded 100 shares at $10, 200 shares at $15, and 300 shares at $20, the VWAP is calculated as:
  \[ \text{VWAP} = \frac{(100 \times 10) + (200 \times 15) + (300 \times 20)}{100 + 200 + 300} = 17.50 \]

#### Rank üî¢
- **Definition:** A function that assigns a relative ranking to each stock based on a specific value.
- **Example:** If you rank stocks based on their returns, the stock with the highest return gets rank 1, the second-highest gets rank 2, and so on.

#### Linear Decay üìâ
- **Definition:** A function that decreases the value linearly over time.
- **Example:** If the initial value is 1 and it decreases by 0.1 each day, after 5 days the value will be 0.5.

#### Market Neutralization ‚öñÔ∏è
- **Definition:** A strategy that balances long and short positions to reduce exposure to the overall market movements.
- **Example:** If you invest $1 million in stocks you expect to go up (long positions) and $1 million in stocks you expect to go down (short positions), you are market-neutral. If the market goes up or down, your losses and gains from long and short positions should balance out.

### Performance Metrics

#### Sharpe Ratio üìà
- **Definition:** A measure of the risk-adjusted return of an investment. It is the ratio of the return of the investment to its standard deviation.
- **Example:** A Sharpe ratio of 1.58 means the strategy returns 1.58 units of return for every unit of risk.

#### Turnover üîÑ
- **Definition:** The percentage of the portfolio that is bought and sold over a period.
- **Example:** A turnover rate of 49% means that nearly half of the portfolio's holdings are changed during the period.

#### Annual Returns üìÖ
- **Definition:** The percentage gain or loss in the value of the portfolio over a year.
- **Example:** An annual return of 23% means the portfolio's value increases by 23% over a year.

#### Fitness üí™
- **Definition:** A measure of how well the alpha fits the historical data.
- **Example:** A fitness of 1.09 suggests the alpha performs 9% better than expected based on historical data.

### Why It Works
1. **Refined Mean Reversion:** This strategy focuses on stocks that have recently peaked and then declined, targeting those with potential for reversion to the mean.
2. **Accurate Pricing with VWAP:** Using VWAP provides a more accurate measure of the average price, improving the strategy‚Äôs accuracy.
3. **Relative Comparison:** The use of percentages allows for fair comparison across different stocks, and clamping the denominator avoids skewing the results due to outliers.
4. **Market Neutralization:** By being market-neutral, the strategy minimizes exposure to market-wide movements, reducing risk and focusing on the relative performance of stocks.

### Learning Points for Beginners
- **Combining Metrics:** Learn how combining different metrics (price, time, volume) can refine a strategy.
- **Using VWAP:** Understand the importance of VWAP for a more accurate measure of average price.
- **Key Metrics:** Familiarize yourself with key performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, turnover, and annual returns to evaluate strategy effectiveness.
- **Backtesting:** Appreciate the value of historical backtesting to validate strategies before real-world application.

This advanced strategy demonstrates the power of refining simple concepts with additional data and metrics to improve performance while maintaining a disciplined approach to risk management.
